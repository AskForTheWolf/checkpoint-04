## Ruby Basics & Enumerables

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person` (String).

When called the method should print "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?" to the Terminal.

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

```rb
# Your code goes here...
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash...

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby...
- Remove Belle from `residents`
- Add her to the `guests` array

Write your code here...

```rb
# Your code goes here...
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friends' names...

```rb
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` and string interpolation, print the following text to the Terminal...

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

```rb
# Your code goes here...
```

## Ruby OOP

### Question 4

Create Ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`. Each `Animal` should have...
- A `name` (String) attribute
- A `greet` instance method
- The ability to "get" and "set" `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba".

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class. The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have...
- A `king` (Boolean) attribute
- If the instance's `name` is "Simba", set the `king` attribute to `true`

Create a new lion instance with the name "Simba".

```rb
# Your code goes here...
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD)...
- Genie
- Lamp
- Person
- Pet

```
Your answer goes here...
```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database.

```
Your answer goes here...
```

### Question 7

> This question has two parts.

Consider a class `Person` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` and has the following schema...

```rb
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
);
```

Write Ruby code that will create an instance of a person...

```rb
# Your code goes here...
```

Write Ruby code that will query for any person that is 15 years of age...

```ruby
# Your code goes here...
```

### Question 8

Write a route in Sinatra that will print "Hello world" in the web browser at the following URL: `http://localhost:4567/oh_hello`

```ruby
# Your code goes here...
```
